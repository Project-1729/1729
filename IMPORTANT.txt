Hey there, curious one.

We see you've started digging through the branches... but this path leads nowhere.

This project is a structured challenge. Each clue is meant to be followed in order.  
Jumping ahead or brute-forcing branches will only waste your time â€” and ruin the fun.

Please, return to where you left off and follow the intended path.

Trust us. It's better that way.
