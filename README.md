If you’ve reached this branch by following the clues, congratulations — you’re progressing correctly.  
If, however, you found this by manually checking branches one by one, we suggest you return and follow the intended path.  
This is a game of perception and logic, not brute force.

We won't punish you, but know this:  
**If you lie, we’ll know.**  
And if you're honest, the journey will reward you.

Follow the trail. Trust the signs. The number matters: **1729**
