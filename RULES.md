# Project 1729 – Rules of Conduct

Welcome to Project 1729. If you're reading this, you're already part of something different.

These are the **only rules** you are expected to follow during your time inside the Project.

---

## Spoilers & Progression

- **Do not share solutions or hints on how to advance.**  
  Solving the puzzles is part of the journey. Everyone deserves the same challenge you had.

- **General technical doubts are allowed**, such as:
  - “Is this executable safe?”
  - “I’m getting an error, is anyone else?”

- **Anything that gives an advantage in solving puzzles or reveals content from hidden paths is strictly forbidden.**

---

## Violations & Expulsion

- Any player who shares restricted content (answers, locations of clues, encrypted data, etc.) will be **permanently expelled**.
- You will be notified. The decision is final.
- If you're unsure whether something can be shared: **Don’t share it.**

PD: All public interaction must happen through the Discussions tab. If you are caught sharing solutions elsewhere, you'll be banned from all future games.

Good luck,  
– Project 1729
