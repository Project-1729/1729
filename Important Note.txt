We assume you've noticed the presence of a file named decrypter.exe, which is an executable. Please be aware that if you run it on Windows, you might receive a warning indicating it's potentially dangerous. Trust us — it isn't. If you feel more comfortable, you're welcome to run it in a virtual machine or any other safe environment.

We understand that, due to its name and the fact that it's from an unknown publisher (that would be us ;) ), your system might flag it as potentially capable of encryption or similar activities. That can be a bit alarming, but rest assured — you can delete it after the game if you wish. It's simply a small program written in Python designed to decrypt messages during the game using a key.

You could even search for its source code — but really, it doesn't matter. You'll see it's completely harmless. In fact, if you scan it with a more advanced antivirus, you'll likely find that it isn’t flagged as a threat at all.
