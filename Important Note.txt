We assume you have noticed that there is a file called decripter.exe, which is an executable file. Please note that if you run it from Windows, you may receive a warning that it is potentially dangerous. Trust us, it isn't. If you feel more comfortable, you can run it on a virtual machine or however you prefer. We assume that, because it has that name and is from an unknown publisher (us ; ) ), it detects it is possibly being able to encrypt anything or something similar. We know that it can be scary, but you can also delete it after the game. It doesn't matter; it's just a simple program made in Python to decrypt messages during the game using a key. We believe that you could even search for its source code, but it doesn't matter. You will see that it is completely harmless. In fact, if you analyze it with a more powerful antivirus, you will see that it does not detect it as a threat.
